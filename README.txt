Whatsapp-like Server-Client Service, implemented in C++ (OS course)

A linux communication protocol between a server and a client which demonstrates Whatsapp.
This project allows to create a server and several clients (in different terminals) which connect and communicate with it, using sockets. The server allows the clients to send messages to each other, to request a list of registered clients, to create chat groups of clients and send messages to them. All communication is done through the server using sockets.
